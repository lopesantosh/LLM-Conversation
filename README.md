# Finetune a Large language Model for Text Conversation Between Two People

This repository contains the code for developing and finetuning a GPT-like Large Language Model (LLM) for text conversation between two people. 

# Running Python file
For finetuning, run the python file finetuning.py. It will load the dataset, load and download the language model GPT2 in a local folder, and run the training loop.  

# Hardware Requirements
The code is designed to run on conventional laptops within a reasonable timeframe and does not require specialized hardware. Additionally, the code automatically utilizes GPUs if they are available.
